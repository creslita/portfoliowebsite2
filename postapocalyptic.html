              <div class="text4">This report investigates the Post-Apocalyptic Videogame Genre and tries to find the element that makes both the
                genre and the worlds that are loved by many people this popular. <span class="typing-2"></span>
              </div>
              <br>
              <p>To ensure that; first, we will investigate the
                history of storytelling and how the video game narrative affects and changes it, and how cutscenes play a part in
                this process. With these, we will have an understanding of how storytelling in video games is shaped as a new
                genre. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Then we will look into people's interest in the post-apocalyptic genre and the elements that a designer needs
                to create the world's narrative and aesthetic. I believe without understanding the desig process of the
                post-apocalyptic worlds, we can not understand the elements that are used to create a story. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>After that, we will
                investigate ten games to pinpoint the elements that ensure the world's success, which is, as we will find out, mostly
                storytelling.The aim of this task is to understand what the consumer, in this case gamers, like and does not like.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>We
                will also investigate the effects of level design and atmosphere of these games to argue about how they shape the
                storytelling of these video game worlds. How they add to the story of the game and can make the player understand
                the story with small hints. The environment design of any game adds to the story massively and creates an
                emotional response in the player. In post-apocalyptic genre however, it is one of the key elements that shows the
                player the hints of the past.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>After we agree on the
                importance of storytelling in post-apocalyptic video game worlds, we will investigate the implementation of this
                research in the game we designed.
